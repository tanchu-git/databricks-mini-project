This part of the project has not been setup with Unity Catalog. Nor, am I using the Auto Loader. Databricks enables users to mount cloud object storage to the Databricks File System (DBFS), even though Databricks recommends migrating away from using mounts. It stills makes for a good learning experience, together with Azure Key Vault.
